## üîê **Authentication & Security**

### User Registration Process

#### **Multi-Step Registration (6 Steps)**

The registration process is designed to be secure and user-friendly, breaking down the account creation into manageable steps:

**Step 1: Email Verification**

- User enters email address
- System generates a 6-digit verification code
- Code is sent via SMTP email service
- User must verify email before proceeding
- Prevents fake email addresses and spam accounts

**Step 2: Email Code Validation**

- User enters the 6-digit code received by email
- System validates code against stored verification code
- Code expires after 15 minutes for security
- User can request new code after 60 seconds cooldown

**Step 3: Personal Information**

- User provides first name, last name, and date of birth
- System calculates age and validates minimum age requirement
- Information is stored securely in encrypted database

**Step 4: Username Selection**

- User chooses unique username
- System checks availability in real-time via AJAX
- Username must be 3-30 characters, alphanumeric + underscores
- Instant feedback on availability

**Step 5: Password Creation**

- User creates and confirms password
- System validates password strength requirements
- Password is hashed using Django's secure hashing algorithms
- No plain text passwords are ever stored

**Step 6: Account Finalization**

- System creates user account with all provided information
- User is automatically logged in
- Welcome message and redirect to profile page
- Account is marked as email-verified

#### **Email Verification System**

### User Login Process

#### **Multi-Step Login (3 Steps)**

The login process implements security best practices with multiple verification layers:

**Step 1: Credential Verification**

- User enters email/username and password
- System validates credentials against database
- Failed attempts are logged for security monitoring
- Account lockout after multiple failed attempts

**Step 2: 2FA Method Selection**

- User chooses between email 2FA or TOTP 2FA
- Choice is remembered for future logins
- User can change 2FA method in settings

**Step 3: 2FA Code Verification**

- User enters the appropriate 2FA code
- System validates code and creates secure session
- Login success is logged with device information
- User is redirected to intended page
