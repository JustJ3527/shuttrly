## üîê **Authentication & Security**

### User Registration Process

#### **Multi-Step Registration (6 Steps)**

The registration process is designed to be secure and user-friendly, breaking down the account creation into manageable steps:

**Step 1: Email Verification**
- [x] User enters email address
- [x] System generates a 6-digit verification code
- [x] Code is sent via SMTP email service
- [x] User must verify email before proceeding
- [x] Prevents fake email addresses and spam accounts

**Step 2: Email Code Validation**
- [x] User enters the 6-digit code received by email
- [x] System validates code against stored verification code
- [x] Code expires after 15 minutes for security
- [x] User can request new code after 60 seconds cooldown

**Step 3: Personal Information**
- [x] User provides first name, last name, and date of birth
- [x] System calculates age and validates minimum age requirement
- [x] Information is stored securely in encrypted database

**Step 4: Username Selection**
- [x] User chooses unique username
- [x] System checks availability in real-time via AJAX
- [x] Username must be 3-30 characters, alphanumeric + underscores
- [x] Instant feedback on availability

**Step 5: Password Creation**
- [x] User creates and confirms password
- [x] System validates password strength requirements
- [x] Password is hashed using Django's secure hashing algorithms
- [x] No plain text passwords are ever stored
