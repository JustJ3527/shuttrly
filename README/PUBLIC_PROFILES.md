# Public User Profiles

This document describes the public profile functionality that allows users to view public information about other users on the platform.

## Overview

The public profile system provides a way for users to share their information publicly while maintaining privacy controls. Users can set their profiles to private, making them invisible to other users.

## URL Structure

Public profiles are accessible via the following URL pattern:

```
/user/<username>/
```

### Examples:

- `/user/john_doe/` - View John Doe's public profile
- `/user/alice_smith/` - View Alice Smith's public profile

## Features

### Public Profile Display

- **Username**: The user's unique username
- **Full Name**: First and last name (if provided)
- **Profile Picture**: User's profile picture or default placeholder
- **Bio**: User's biography/about section (if provided)
- **Join Date**: When the user joined the platform
- **Last Seen**: Last login date (if available)
- **Online Status**: Current online/offline status
- **Edit Buttons**: For profile owners to edit their profile

### Privacy Controls

- **Public Profiles**: Visible to all users
- **Private Profiles**: Only visible to the profile owner
- **Anonymous Users**: Cannot access private profiles

### Security Features

- Private profiles don't reveal user existence to unauthorized users
- Only active, non-anonymized users are accessible
- Profile owners can edit their own profiles

## Implementation Details

### View Function

The `public_user_profile_view` function handles all public profile requests:

```python
def public_user_profile_view(request, username):
    """
    Display public profile of a user by username.

    Args:
        request: HTTP request object
        username: Username of the user whose profile to display

    Returns:
        Rendered template with user profile data or appropriate messages
    """
```

### Template

The `public_profile.html` template provides three different views:

1. **Public Profile**: Shows user information in a modern, fluid layout
2. **Private Profile**: Shows privacy message with consistent styling
3. **User Not Found**: Shows error message for non-existent users

### Design Philosophy

The template now follows a modern, fluid design philosophy inspired by popular social platforms:

- **Organic Flow**: Information flows naturally without rigid structures
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear visual separation with subtle shadows and spacing
- **Modern Aesthetics**: Clean, minimalist design with smooth transitions
- **Social Media Feel**: Layout reminiscent of Instagram, Facebook, and VSCO

### Layout Structure

The new fluid design features:

- **Profile Header**: Large avatar with flowing information layout
- **Stats Display**: Horizontal stats with consistent badge styling
- **Status Badges**: Same design as profile.html for visual consistency
- **Social Actions**: Follow and Message buttons for visitor interaction
- **Info Cards**: Flexible information display with icons
- **Posts Grid**: Placeholder grid for future photo sharing
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes

### CSS Styling

The template uses modern CSS classes for the fluid design:

- `.profile-container-fluid`: Main container with modern spacing
- `.profile-header-fluid`: Fluid header with flexible layout and colored borders
- `.profile-stats-fluid`: Horizontal stats display with colorful accents
- `.info-card-fluid`: Flexible information cards with left border accents
- `.posts-grid-fluid`: Responsive grid for future posts with colorful placeholders

### Color Scheme

The design uses a vibrant color palette inspired by the main profile page:

- **Primary Color**: #84A98C (green-teal) for borders, accents, and highlights
- **Secondary Color**: #527970 (darker green) for gradients and hover effects
- **Text Colors**: #2F3D46 (dark) for headings, #495057 for body text
- **Status Badges**: Same design as profile.html with #d4edda/#155724 for online, #f8d7da/#721c24 for offline
- **Social Buttons**: #84A98C primary, #527970 hover states
- **Background**: Clean white with subtle colored borders instead of shadows

### Social Features

The public profile system includes interactive social elements:

- **Follow Button**: Allows visitors to follow users (primary button styling)
- **Message Button**: Enables direct messaging with users (outline button styling)
- **Smart Display Logic**:
  - Hidden for profile owners (shows edit buttons instead)
  - Available for visitors and anonymous users
  - Works with both public and private profiles
- **Authentication Handling**:
  - Authenticated users see interactive buttons
  - Anonymous users get redirected to login page
- **Responsive Design**: Buttons adapt to different screen sizes
- **Hover Effects**: Smooth animations with color transitions

### Private Profile Handling

The system intelligently handles private profiles:

- **Limited Information Display**: Shows only username, profile picture, and name
- **Social Actions Available**: Follow and Message buttons still accessible
- **Privacy Message**: Clear indication that the profile is private
- **Owner Access**: Profile owners can see their full private profile
- **Visitor Experience**: Visitors get a taste of the profile without full access

## Usage Examples

### Viewing a Public Profile

1. Navigate to `/user/username/`
2. View the user's public information
3. If the profile is private, you'll see a privacy message

### Setting Your Profile to Private

1. Go to your profile settings
2. Enable the "Private Profile" option
3. Your profile will only be visible to you

### Editing Your Public Profile

1. Visit your own public profile
2. Click the "Edit Profile" button
3. Make changes and save

## Technical Notes

### Database Queries

- Users are filtered by `is_anonymized=False` and `is_active=True`
- Private profile checks are performed efficiently

### Template Tags

- Uses custom `datetime_tags` for date formatting
- Modern CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
- Custom fluid CSS classes for modern design

### Error Handling

- Graceful handling of non-existent users
- Privacy-aware error messages
- No information leakage about private profiles
